# Archetypes of NBA Players (2023 – 2024)
This notebook explores player statistics from the 2023-2024 NBA regular season. The goal was to apply statistical analysis and machine learning techniques in hopes of moving beyond traditional basketball positions and uncover patterns that represent the evolving roles in today's game. 

Some key steps that were taken are as follows:
1. **Data Preparation** – Data cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure accuracy and usability.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing and analyzing player statistics to determine key trends and features.
3. **Clustering Analysis** – Grouping the players into specific archetypes by using machine learning methods.
4. **Conclusions and Insights** – Summarizing the findings and discussing their involvment for team strategy. 

By using these insights along with the gathered datasets covering the regular season, the playoffs, and the salaries of all players in the league, a 15 player team will be constructed according to archetypes and models defined.
